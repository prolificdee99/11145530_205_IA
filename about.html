            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>
              This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
              Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
              society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
              Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
              science involves the study and development of applications that
              allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that
              support these applications, and the means and methods used to
              produce both applications and systems that behave reliably,
              correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the
              skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer
              Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current
              techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering
              principles to the development, construction and maintenance of
              computer programs. The range of courses available in the
              department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find
              employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our
              graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team
              (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to
              bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the
              platform for further study or research through exposure to
              established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active
              fields of research in Computer Science. The Department offers two
              undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer
              Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well
              as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
