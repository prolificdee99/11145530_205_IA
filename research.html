        <h3>Artificial Intelligence Research</h3>
        <p>
          Our AI research focuses on AI research focuses on developing and
          applying computational methods that can perform tasks that normally
          require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, perception,
          decision making, and communication. AI research is a broad and
          interdisciplinary field that draws from various disciplines, such as
          computer science, mathematics, statistics, engineering, psychology,
          linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience

            Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning for Industrial
            Equipment
          </h4>
          <p>
            This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system
            for industrial machinery using advanced machine learning techniques.
            The goal is to leverage historical sensor data, such as temperature,
            vibration, and usage patterns, to predict potential equipment
            failures before they occur. By implementing machine learning models,
            the system aims to provide accurate predictions, allowing for
            proactive maintenance interventions, reducing downtime, and
            optimizing the overall efficiency of industrial operations.

          <h4>
            Adaptive Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning and
            Network Flow Analysis
          </h4>
          <p>
            This research project aims to design and implement an adaptive
            intrusion detection system (IDS) that combines machine learning
            algorithms with in-depth network flow analysis. The system will
            dynamically learn and adapt to evolving cyber threats, enhancing the
            detection accuracy and reducing false positives. By leveraging both
            anomaly detection and signature-based approaches, the IDS aims to
            provide robust protection against a wide range of network security
            threats, including novel and sophisticated attacks.
